# HBase TAggregator

HBase Aggregator implementation for timeseries based aggregations.

It is meant to allow for much faster aggregations when time intervals are at play. For example, whn aggregating a day's worth of data down to 15min averages, you'd need 96 queries doing 96 scans using the standard aggregate implementation. TAggregator will do the same thing requiring just one query using a single scan, producing a Map of 96 TimeStamp-Value assignments.

## Supported Features

* Max
* Min
* Sum
* Avg

## TODO

* Fix pom (It is currently just more or less ripped out of the hbase examples and does not actually work)
* Add test cases for limits provided via scan
* Fix Javadocs
* Currently, when running with a scanner provided timerange, the result will be different from when running with a directly supplied range. The reason for this is, that when providing a range Ã  la 10/10/2014 00:00-02:00 the scanner will cut off at 02:00, whereas the directly supplied range will also give the result for the range starting at 02:00.

## Planned Features

* Weighted avg

## Usage

```java
int interval = 900;
int time_min = (int) ((new GregorianCalendar(2014, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0).getTime().getTime()) / 1000);
int time_max = (int) ((new GregorianCalendar(2014, 10, 10, 1, 59, 59).getTime().getTime()) / 1000);
String KEY_FILTER_PATTERN = "00000001111";


Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.addFamily(FAMILY);
TimeseriesAggregationClient tsac = new TimeseriesAggregationClient(conf, interval, time_min, time_max, KEY_FILTER_PATTERN);
ConcurrentSkipListMap<Long, Long> maximum = tsac.max(TEST_TABLE, ci, scan);
```

*Note:* For the KEY_FILTER_PATTERN it is assumed, that somewhere in your Key, there is an Integer timestamp (in seconds). The pattern masks the position of this integer in the key using 1s. naturally, it is also assumed, that Keys handled during this operation are fixed length.

Alternatively, you can provide the total time range (time_min,time_max) via the scan object. In this case, you do not provide it to the Coprocessor, itself:


```java
int interval = 900;
int time_min = (int) ((new GregorianCalendar(2014, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0).getTime().getTime()) / 1000);
int time_max = (int) ((new GregorianCalendar(2014, 10, 10, 1, 59, 59).getTime().getTime()) / 1000);


Scan scan = new Scan();
scan.addFamily(FAMILY);
scan.setTimeRange(time_min, time_max)
TimeseriesAggregationClient tsac = new TimeseriesAggregationClient(conf, interval);
ConcurrentSkipListMap<Long, Long> maximum = tsac.max(TEST_TABLE, ci, scan);
```
